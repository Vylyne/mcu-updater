# The Mainsail fork

Mainsail has no plugin API — only CSS theming — so a real panel needs a fork.
This document is the runbook for keeping that fork cheap to maintain.

Fork: **`Vylyne/mainsail`**, working branch **`mu/stable`**.

## Branch layout

Upstream's branches are **`master`** (stable) and **`develop`** (default, active).
There is no upstream `main` — the fork's `main` is our own name for the stable
mirror, so **rebase commands must say `upstream/master`**.

| Branch | Base | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mu/stable` | `upstream/master` | **Primary.** Where the code is written, what CI releases, what the printer installs. |
| `ku/develop` | `upstream/develop` | Cherry-pick target, only when preparing or refreshing an upstream PR. |

Upstream requires PRs target `develop`, which is the only reason the second
branch exists. As of 2026-07-30 `master` and `develop` were on an identical
`package.json` (2.18.2, Vue 2.7 / Vuetify 2 / Vuex 3, no Pinia), so cherry-picking
between them is near-free.

First-time setup:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mainsail-crew/mainsail.git
git fetch upstream --tags
git switch -c mu/stable upstream/master
```

## The delta

**17 files added, 4 edited, zero deletions.** Keeping *the edited list* at four
is the whole strategy.

**The budget is on edited files only.** Added files are fork-only: upstream
never touches them, so they cost nothing at rebase time and are not budgeted.
Growing the added list is how the panel gets features; growing the *edited* list
is what makes a rebase expensive. Do not decline work because it touches many
added files — count only the four below.

Added:

```bash
.github/workflows/mu-ci.yml                                       (fork-only)
src/components/panels/Machine/FirmwareUpdaterPanel.vue
src/components/panels/Machine/FirmwareUpdaterPanel/*.vue          (10 files)
src/store/server/fwUpdater/{index,actions,mutations,getters,types}.ts
```

Edited — this is the entire rebase surface, and the only list with a budget:

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `src/store/socket/actions.ts` | one `case 'notify_agent_event'` in the `onMessage` switch |
| `src/store/server/index.ts` | one import + one entry in `modules` |
| `src/pages/Machine.vue` | one import, one component registration, one element |
| `src/locales/en.json` | a `FirmwareUpdaterPanel` block under `Machine` |

Note `webSocketClient.ts` needs **no** change — it already forwards every
unmatched message to `socket/onMessage`.

## Commits

Upstream requires Conventional Commits. Keep the branch as **exactly 5
upstreamable commits, never squashed**, plus the fork-only CI commit on top so it
can be dropped for a PR:

1. `feat(store): add server/fwUpdater module` — add-only
2. `feat(panels): add FirmwareUpdater components` — add-only
3. `feat(socket): route notify_agent_event to fwUpdater`
4. `feat(store): register the fwUpdater module`
5. `feat(machine): mount FirmwareUpdaterPanel`
6. `chore(ci): fork-only workflow` ← drop when upstreaming

Commits 1–2 are new files and always apply clean. Only 3–5 can conflict, each a
1–3 line hunk in a known location.

## Rebasing

```bash
git fetch upstream --tags
git rebase upstream/master        # routine, on each upstream release
```

Then re-run the gates (below) and tag a release as

`v<one patch ABOVE the upstream you rebased onto>-vylyne.<n>`

so upstream v2.18.2 gives `v2.18.3-vylyne.1`, then `-vylyne.2`, `-vylyne.10`, and
so on without limit. Provenance is obvious in Mainsail's Update Manager panel,
and the two details that look cosmetic are not:

- **One patch above, not the upstream version.** A prerelease sorts *below* its
  base, so `v2.18.2-vylyne.1` is less than upstream's `2.18.2` and Mainsail's UI
  hides it while Moonraker's API cheerfully reports it. Being below the base is
  then a feature: when upstream really ships 2.18.3, it supersedes every
  `2.18.3-vylyne.N`.
- **A dot before the number, never a hyphen.** Semver compares a purely numeric
  prerelease identifier numerically and anything else as text. `vylyne.10` is
  `["vylyne", 10]` and beats `.9`; `vylyne-10` is one string and *loses* to
  `vylyne-9`. That is the old `-fwN` scheme's bug — `fw10 < fw9` — which capped
  it at nine releases per base. Zero-padding or hex only move that cap; the dot
  removes it.

`mu-release.yml` refuses any tag that breaks either rule before it builds
anything, so a mistake here fails loudly instead of publishing a release nobody
is ever offered.

## Releasing

Two steps, deliberately. A tag reaches the beta host; a human decides it reaches
every host.

```bash
git tag -a v2.18.4-vylyne.16 -m "what changed"
git push origin v2.18.4-vylyne.16        # one tag, never --tags
```

The push fires `mu-release.yml`, which builds the tree at that tag and publishes
it as a **prerelease** — visible to `channel: beta`, invisible to
`channel: stable`. Install it on the beta host and check it against the agent it
has to work with.

When it is good, flip that release — the one that was tested — to stable, from
the Releases UI or:

```bash
gh release edit v2.18.4-vylyne.16 --repo Vylyne/mainsail --prerelease=false
```

`--latest` is belt-and-braces rather than load-bearing. GitHub recomputes
"latest" as the most recent non-prerelease by creation date — which is why
`.13` held it while `.14` and `.15` sat as prereleases — so clearing the
prerelease flag moves the pointer on its own. Moonraker's update manager and
athena-updater compare versions out of the release list rather than reading the
pointer at all. Pass it anyway: it states the intent, and it is the one thing
that would matter if `latest` had ever been pinned by hand to something older.

One way to get this wrong, and it is silent:

- **Do not promote by re-running `mu-release` with `stable: true`.** That
  rebuilds, so what reaches every host is a fresh bundle rather than the one the
  beta host has been running. `npm ci` against a lockfile usually makes those
  identical, which is the wrong kind of "usually" here — the point of the beta
  channel is that a *specific artifact* was exercised. The input stays for the
  case promotion cannot serve: publishing a tag straight to stable with no beta
  to promote.

`mu-release.yml`'s guard checks the tag sorts above whatever the channel it is
publishing to already has — the newest of any kind for beta, the newest
non-prerelease for stable. Those are different questions, because the two
channels read different endpoints, and asking the beta question about a stable
publish refuses valid promotions.

**Never `git push --tags`.** `git fetch upstream --tags` brings in ~95 of
upstream's own release tags, and they are worth having locally — they are how you
know what upstream has shipped. Pushing them to the fork is the problem: the
release workflow used to trigger on `v*`, so one `--tags` would have fired ~95
builds. It now triggers on `v*-vylyne.*` only, so an accidental push is a no-op —
but push tags one at a time regardless:

```bash
git push origin v2.18.5-vylyne.1     # yes
git push --tags                      # no
```

## Keeping up with upstream

`mu-upstream-sync.yml` runs daily. It rebases `mu/stable` onto
`upstream/master` **on a scratch branch**, runs every gate against the result,
and then either opens a PR (clean, and green) or an issue (conflicts, or the
gates failed). It never touches `mu/stable`: landing a rebase means a force-push
to the branch releases are cut from, which is not an unattended operation.

The gates matter more than the conflict check. A rebase that applies cleanly and
then fails to build is upstream having changed something the panel depends on —
invisible to a merge check, and the case worth hearing about early.

To refresh an upstream PR: `git switch ku/develop && git cherry-pick <the 5>`.

**Check for API drift before starting any phase.** Upstream has a live
`feat/rework-init-process` branch, and a Vue 3 / Vuetify 3 / Pinia migration would
invalidate every added file:

```bash
git diff upstream/master..upstream/develop -- package.json
git diff upstream/master..upstream/develop -- \
    src/store/socket/actions.ts src/store/server/index.ts src/pages/Machine.vue
```

## Gates

Locally, before every push:

```bash
npm run lint:fix    # eslint src --fix
npm run test:unit   # vitest run
npm run build       # vite build (+ build.zip, see below)
npx prettier --write src/store/server/fwUpdater src/components/panels/Machine/FirmwareUpdaterPanel*
```

CI uses the **non-mutating** variants (`--check`, `lint`) — the mutating ones
would let CI pass by rewriting the code it is meant to police.

### Two gotchas on a Windows dev box

**Set `core.autocrlf=false` in this clone.** With the global `autocrlf=true`, the
working tree is CRLF, and Prettier's default `endOfLine: "lf"` then fails **628
files** — the entire repo, including files you never touched. It looks
catastrophic and means nothing. Fix once:

```bash
git config core.autocrlf false
git rm -r --cached -q . && git reset --hard
```

**`npm run build` fails at the last step on Windows.** Upstream's `build.zip`
script shells out to a Unix `zip` binary. The `vite build` itself (including the
`vite-plugin-checker` TypeScript pass) completes fine — only the packaging step
fails, and CI on ubuntu has `zip`. To produce the artifact locally anyway, zip
`dist/` yourself.

### Why CI scopes Prettier

`npm run format:check` covers the whole repo, and **upstream/master does not pass
its own check** — `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` fail on a
pristine checkout. Running it unscoped would go red on inherited debt while
saying nothing about our code, so `mu-ci.yml` checks only the files this fork
owns. ESLint *is* run unscoped, because upstream does pass that cleanly, which
means any error there is genuinely ours.

`npm run build` emits `dist/mainsail.zip` via upstream's own script, so releases
just attach that artifact. Run `npm run i18n-extract` after touching `en.json` to
confirm every `$t()` key resolves.

## Installing on the printer

Point Mainsail's own Update Manager at the fork — one line in `moonraker.conf`:

```ini
[update_manager mainsail]
type: web
channel: stable
repo: Vylyne/mainsail        # was mainsail-crew/mainsail
path: ~/mainsail
```

You then update the UI from inside the UI, and revert to stock by pointing
`repo:` back and updating again.

## Upstream symbols depended on

If a rebase fails, these are the four things to check first:

- the `switch (payload.method)` in `store/socket/actions.ts::onMessage`
- the `modules: { … }` block in `store/server/index.ts`
- the right-hand column layout in `pages/Machine.vue`
- `components/ui/Panel.vue`'s props (`title`, `icon`, `cardClass`, `collapsible`)

Plus the class-component style itself: `@Component`, `Mixins(BaseMixin)`,
`Vue.$socket.emit`, Vuetify 2 components.

## Is the fork permanent?

Probably not. Upstream absorbs third-party integrations as first-class panels —
`MmuPanel` (Happy Hare), `AfcPanel`, and `SpoolmanPanel` are all upstream now —
and the panel is deliberately built to be upstreamable: `v-if` gated on the agent
being present, no hard dependency in any init path, standard `Panel`/`BaseMixin`/
`$socket.emit`, English-only locale additions, and placed on `Machine.vue` where
upstream would want it.

⚠️ But upstream runs a **vouch-based review system** that can auto-close a new
contributor's PR. Open an issue describing the agent and panel *before* writing
the PR, and treat a merge as upside rather than the plan. The fork has to stand on
its own — which is what the 4-file edit budget buys.
