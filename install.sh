  klipper unit, no wildcards) lets the agent recover on its own. Declining is
  safe - the systemd unit's ExecStopPost still covers some cases - but the net
  is weaker, and the CLI will prompt for a password when it stops klipper.

================================================================
 mcu-updater agent installed.

 Check it registered with Moonraker:

   curl -s http://localhost:7125/server/extensions/list

 ...should list an agent named "mcu_updater". Then try it:

   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:7125/server/extensions/request \\
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
     -d '{"agent":"mcu_updater","method":"fw.status","arguments":{}}'

 Logs:   ${PRINTER_DATA}/logs/mcu-updater.log
         (not in Mainsail's Logfiles panel - that lists a fixed set - but it is
          downloadable through Moonraker's file manager)
 Status: sudo systemctl status ${SERVICE_NAME}

 The CLI is unchanged and still works:  ${INSTALL_PATH}/src/updatefw.py status

 The systemd unit is 'mcu-updater', deliberately not 'klipper-*': KIAUH
 matches ^klipper(-[0-9a-zA-Z]+)?.service$ and would mistake it for a Klipper
 instance.

 For the Mainsail panel, point your Update Manager at the fork by changing
 one line in moonraker.conf:

   [update_manager mainsail]
   repo: Vylyne/mainsail        # was mainsail-crew/mainsail

 Config:    ${MAIN_CONFIG}     (backed up, editable in Mainsail)
              one file: the [updater] section and one [mcu ...] per board
 Artifacts: ${DATA_PATH}        (generated, not backed up)

 Flashing from the web UI is OFF by default. To enable it, add to the
 [updater] section of ${MAIN_CONFIG}:

   [updater]
   enable_flashing: true

 ...then: sudo systemctl restart ${SERVICE_NAME}
