"""Klipper/Katapult firmware management.

Layered deliberately so the same logic serves both the interactive CLI and a
long-running Moonraker agent:

  errors/paths/settings/config/devices  - pure, no side effects beyond the FS
  lock/build/flash/service              - do real work, report via a callback
  providers                             - the build systems, behind one protocol
  cli/tui                               - the ONLY place input()/sys.exit()/
                                          print() are allowed to appear

Anything importable by the agent must never block on a terminal.
