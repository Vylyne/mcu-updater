"""The agent's JSON-RPC surface.

Every method takes one object and returns one object, and **every method returns
in well under a second**. That is a hard rule, not a guideline: Moonraker awaits
our reply with no timeout, so anything slow would hold a front end's HTTP request
open. Long-running work (build, flash) returns a job id immediately instead -
those arrive in a later phase.

The shapes here are the contract with the Mainsail panel. They are documented in
``docs/agent-api.md`` and version-gated by ``fw.ping``'s ``api_version``.

        `serial:` writes it in printer.cfg directly, and `device_id:` names the
        display by the id burned into its chip and leaves discovery to find the
        path - which the module then reports back in its own `get_status()`.

        something to disagree with. This reads the same `configfile.settings`
        payload `mcu_info` already fetches for the version join.

        A `device_id:` section belongs in the list even before discovery finds
        it - `present: false`, every live field `None` - because a display that
        needs flashing is precisely the one this must not be blind to. See
        knomi_serial's docs/protocol.md, "The device map".

        No identity beyond the port, deliberately: every display runs the same
        image, so which physical unit sits on which port does not change what
        gets written to it. The port is the whole story for flashing.

        `present` is the field that matters, because the klippy module hides this
        case. It catches a missing symlink or a device that never enumerated -

        Deliberately **reports** failures instead of raising them. Every other
        method treats a refusal as an error because the caller asked for work to
        happen; here, describing the situation *is* the work. "dfu-util is not
        installed" is this method's answer, not its failure.

        The distinctions are not cosmetic - each sends the user somewhere else:

        ``no_tool``
            `apt install dfu-util`. Nothing to do with the board.
        ``permission_denied``
            libusb saw a board and could not claim it. **The boot jumper worked.**
            Reporting this as "no device found" is what once sent a user back to
            redo the one step that had succeeded. The udev rule tags `uaccess`,
            which grants the *seated* user - and this agent is a daemon, not a
            login session - so in practice it rides on `GROUP="plugdev"` and the
            service user being in that group.
        ``none``
            Genuinely nothing in DFU. Fit the boot jumper and replug.
        ``ambiguous``
            More than one board in DFU, and no serial was named to pick between
            them. Not a dead end: dfu-util takes `-S/-p/-n`, so naming one is
            enough - `ready` is false only because the *caller* has not chosen.
