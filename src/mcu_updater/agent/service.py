"""The long-running agent process.

Connect to Moonraker's unix socket, identify as an agent, register our methods,
then serve requests until the socket drops - and reconnect forever when it does.

Two properties matter more than anything else here:

* **Reconnect is unconditional.** Moonraker restarts (its own update manager does
  it), and the agent must come back without help.
* **Work outlives the connection.** In later phases a build or flash will be in
  flight when Moonraker restarts. Losing the socket must not abort it, which is
  why the connection is a replaceable field rather than the thing that owns
  state.
