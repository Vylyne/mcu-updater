class FlashLog:
    """What was last written to each board, and from which binary.

    The gap this closes: a board reports its klipper *commit* and nothing else, so
    two builds from the same commit - a changed ``.config``, an edited
    ``makefile_patches`` source - are indistinguishable from the board's side. A
    version comparison therefore cannot tell you that a board is running last
    week's buffer patch, and "flash only the stale ones" would quietly skip exactly
    the boards that needed it.

    Recording the binary's sha256 against the serial closes that: once a rebuild
    changes the artifact, every board that still holds the old one is identifiable.

    It is *our* record rather than the board's truth, so it is only ever used to
    add confidence, never to remove it. A board flashed by hand outside this tool
    leaves an entry that disagrees with the board's running commit, and
    :meth:`entry_for` discards it rather than reporting a stale answer with a
    straight face.
