"""Discovering boards under ``/dev/serial/by-id``.

Entries look like ``usb-<fw>_<chipset>_<serial>``, e.g.::

    usb-Klipper_stm32g0b1xx_290055001850304158373620-if00
    usb-katapult_stm32f072xb_4C0033000957465331323720-if00

The firmware component's capitalisation is **not** dependable - it has been
observed as both ``Klipper`` and ``klipper`` depending on the board and klipper
version. The original code compared it case-insensitively when *discovering*
devices but rebuilt the path with an exact-case f-string when *flashing*, so a
board enumerating as lowercase was found and then declared missing.

Everything here therefore matches case-insensitively and returns the real
on-disk path rather than a reconstructed one.
