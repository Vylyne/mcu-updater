"""Flashing boards.

Two paths:

* **katapult** - the normal case. A board already running Klipper is asked to
  reboot into its bootloader, waited for, then written via katapult's
  ``flashtool.py``.
* **dfu-util** - the first-ever flash of a bare STM32, which has no bootloader
  yet to speak flashtool's protocol.

Cancellation is deliberately *not* plumbed into the write step. Interrupting
``flashtool -f`` part-way through leaves a board with half a firmware image.
Callers cancel between devices, never during one.
