"""Remembering which type a freshly-bootloadered board was meant to become.

`add_mcu.start` waits a short while for the board to come back as Katapult and
then reports it. When it does come back in time, this file is not needed - the
job already knows what it is. This exists for every other case:

* the board takes longer than the wait (a marginal port, a chain of hubs);
* it is unplugged after flashing and brought back later;
* the agent restarted in between.

In all of those the board arrives as an anonymous untracked device and the
intent - "this is a bttebb36" - is lost, even though the user stated it clearly
a minute earlier.

**Keyed on the DFU serial**, because that is the only identifier that exists on
both sides of the transition. A board in DFU has no ``/dev/serial/by-id`` name at
all, and the name it gets afterwards is not knowable in advance - but the reverse
*is* computable (`devices.dfu_serial_for`), so a board appearing later can be
matched back to what we wrote to it.

Deliberately expiring: a pairing that could still act a month later would be a
surprise, and surprise is the one thing an automatic registry edit must not be.
