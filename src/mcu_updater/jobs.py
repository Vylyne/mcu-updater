"""Long-running operations, run one at a time.

A build takes minutes and a flash stops the printer's firmware, so this is a
**single slot, not a queue**. Submitting while something is running fails
immediately with `BusyError` naming the incumbent. A queue would be worse: the
user asks for one thing, walks away, and comes back to find a second operation
they'd forgotten they asked for started by itself.

The exclusive file lock is taken in `submit`, before the worker starts, so a CLI
build already in progress makes the RPC call fail synchronously with a useful
message rather than producing a job that dies a moment later.
