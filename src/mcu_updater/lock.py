"""Cross-process exclusion for build/flash operations.

A file lock rather than an in-process mutex, because the CLI and the agent are
separate processes and both can build and flash. ``flock`` is released by the
kernel when the holding process dies, so there are no stale locks to clean up
after a crash - which is exactly the failure mode a pidfile gets wrong.

The lock file carries ``{pid, label, since}`` so a caller who loses the race can
say *who* is holding it rather than just "busy".
