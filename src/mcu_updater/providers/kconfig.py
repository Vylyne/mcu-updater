"""Reading and editing a firmware tree's Kconfig from something other than a TTY.

``menuconfig`` is ncurses and needs a terminal, which is the last thing in this
tool that cannot be driven from a browser. This module loads the *tree's own*
kconfiglib and turns its menus into JSON.

Three things here are non-obvious, and all three were established by experiment
against kconfiglib 14.1.0 rather than assumed.

**The library comes from the firmware tree, never from pip.** Klipper vendors a
locally patched kconfiglib at ``lib/kconfiglib/``; Katapult vendors its own
separate copy. A PyPI kconfiglib would silently disagree with the ``Kconfig``
files it is parsing. So each tree's copy is loaded from its own path, under its
own private module name, without touching ``sys.path``.

**Loading two trees yields two distinct module objects, and the hazard is
``isinstance``, not the constants.** The sentinels - ``MENU``, ``COMMENT``,
``BOOL``, ``STRING`` and so on - are plain small ints, equal across copies, so
comparing them across modules works fine. The *classes* are what differ:
``isinstance(node.item, other_copy.Symbol)`` is ``False``, so any code that
discriminates node kinds using a different copy's classes classifies every symbol
as "not a symbol" and reports nothing useful, with no error anywhere. That is why
:class:`Serializer` takes its module in the constructor and never reads a
module-level constant.

**No ``os.chdir`` is required.** Setting ``srctree`` and passing absolute paths is
enough for parsing, ``load_config`` and ``write_config`` alike - verified with the
cwd deliberately elsewhere and a ``source`` statement in play. That matters
because ``chdir`` is process-global and this runs inside a multithreaded agent, so
holding one for the duration of an operation would break any other thread using a
relative path. ``srctree`` is still an environment variable and therefore also
process-global, but it is only read while the ``Kconfig`` object is constructed -
so it is set, used and restored under a lock, which is a far narrower window than
a chdir would have been.
