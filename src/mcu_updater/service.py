"""Stopping and starting Klipper around a flash, and surviving a crash.

Leaving klipper stopped is the one genuinely bad outcome this tool can produce:
the printer is dead until someone notices and SSHes in. Defence is layered.

1. ``klipper_stopped()`` restores state in a ``finally``.
2. ``MoonrakerService.start()`` falls back to systemd if Moonraker has gone away
   between the stop and the start.
3. A **journal** file records "we stopped it" before stopping, so a process that
   dies outright can be reconciled on next startup.
4. The systemd unit carries an ``ExecStopPost`` net for the case where even that
   doesn't run.

This module owns 1-3.

    **It never journals.** The journal holds exactly one pending stop and

    Klipper's record is the one that must survive.

    **It never verifies, and never raises.** If the watcher will not stop, the
    worst case is the flake this avoids: the upload fails cleanly and a retry
    works. Refusing to flash at all would be a worse outcome than the problem.

    **A unit that is not there is not an error.** `is_active` is false for a
    unit systemd has never heard of, so a host without the watcher installed
    takes this path and says nothing. `None` means the caller has nothing to
