"""Tool settings: the ``[updater]`` section of ``mcu-updater.cfg``.

Shares a file with the MCU registry. They were separate while the registry was
JSON - a settings key inside a dict keyed by board name would have been ugly and
liable to collide with a board called "settings" - but ``.cfg`` sections namespace
cleanly, so there is one file to find and one file to edit.

Reads and writes go through :mod:`cfgdoc`, which means editing a setting from the
panel does not throw away the ``[mcu ...]`` sections, the comments, or anything
else in the file.

Everything has a default, so the section is optional and may be partial.
