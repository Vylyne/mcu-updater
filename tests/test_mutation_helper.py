"""The mutation harness must never leave a mutation on disk.

This is cover for a real incident rather than a hypothetical one. An ad-hoc
version of `scripts/mutation_test.py` crashed *between* mutating a file and
restoring it - not in the mutation, but while decoding the test runner's output
on a console defaulting to cp1252 against a runner emitting UTF-8. The file
stayed broken, and only noticing stood between that and committing a silently
sabotaged guard.

So the property under test is not "does it mutate" but **"is the file always put
back"** - through exceptions, through Ctrl-C, and through a stale anchor.
